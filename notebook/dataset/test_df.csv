"Hi,

So I have been collecting data for a few months using excel. I collect data every day on a few select stocks that appear on a scanner I use. I have been manually inputting some of the information and letting excel formulas calculate lots of the data I need but I am running into a problem collecting chart data.

As of now the data I manually input are dates, stock name, price, volume and change %. I want to capture an image of what the chart for that stock on that day looked like. I have been manually taking screenshots of charts and saving them individually to a folder. Is there a better way to collect the data of the chart? Is there any methods of automating the screenshotting of a program and saving it?

Sorry if this post is in the wrong subreddit. Thanks in advance.",not_spam

A great example of what I am looking for is the NYPD Stop, Question, and Frisk data, which lays out firearm use, taser deployment, and OC spray with XY coordinates for each calendar year.

**REGISTER**:¬†[https://forms.gle/TEFbySkQoPCJzs8H6](https://forms.gle/TEFbySkQoPCJzs8H6)

The dataset consists of 10K COVID English Tweets, including 4719 Tweets labeled as INFORMATIVE and 5281 Tweets labeled as UNINFORMATIVE, in which 8K Tweets are already released for training and validation. Although we provide a default training and validation split of the released data, participants are free to use this data in any way they find useful when training and tuning their systems, e.g. use a different split, perform cross-validation, and the like.

**Short intro (*****copied*****):**

The goals of our shared task are: (1) To develop a language processing task that potentially impacts research and downstream applications, and (2) To provide the community with a new dataset for identifying informative COVID-19 English Tweets.

This shared task is to automatically identify whether a COVID-19 English Tweet is informative or not. Such informative Tweets provide information about recovered, suspected, confirmed and death cases as well as location or travel history of the cases. To be able to achieve the goals of this shared task, we construct a dataset of 10K COVID19 English tweets. We believe our dataset and systems developed for this shared task will be beneficial for the development of COVID-19 related monitoring systems.",not_spam

"For gas stations in America, from San Francisco to New York, I'd like

1.  The price of gas there at a time *t* (e.g. $3.08 regular on June 13th 2016)
2.  The location of the gas station (e.g. 37.426 long., -122.1475 lat.)

Ideally, I'd have this for **every** gas station in the U.S. and for **every** time *t* for each day from 2000 until now. 

I'll settle for as many gas stations as possible for a single (recent) time *t*.

I know how to get this data on particular gas stations, but where can I find this data for all gas stations in America?

"I'm trying to find multi year (USA) Census datasets. Preferably covering the widest range of topics possible (i.e many columns), and I want to get it for multiple years/surveys, so that I can compare changes over time. Ideally it would be as harmonized as possible (i.e the same column names for the same variables over time). I'd want it at multiple geographies if possible.

I tried the census websites, but they've changed the format and I can't find heads or tales in it, nvm long term (e.g. 10-30 years of census data, e.g. all the 5 years ACS estimates for every state/county/zipcode). 

Sorry if this is trivial -  google &amp; [factFinder](https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/download_center.xhtml) failed me, especially when it comes to harmonizing the data. (And this seems like a really common usecase, so I imagine it must be available).

"The TSA has is publishing more and more data via it's Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) Reading Room.

I've created a project on github [https://github.com/mikelor/tsathroughput](https://github.com/mikelor/tsathroughput) that contains the source for extracting the information from the .PDF files and converts them to JSON and CSV files. 

The [/data](https://github.com/mikelor/TsaThroughput/tree/main/data) folder contains the source .PDFs going back to 2018 while the /data/raw/tsa/throughput folder contains .json files.

If you just want to work with the data, I would recommend looking at the [/data/processed/tsa/throughput](https://github.com/mikelor/TsaThroughput/tree/main/data/processed/tsa/throughput) folder. This folder contains .CSV files for individual airports as wall as a .CSV file for All airports (unintuitively named ""TsaThroughput.None.csv""). 

I've broken out the airports that I'm interested in. If you'd like to learn more. Feel free to leave a comment in the ""[Discussions](https://github.com/mikelor/TsaThroughput/discussions)"" section or open an ""[Issue](https://github.com/mikelor/TsaThroughput/issues)"".

While doing some research on Tsa Throughput today, I ran across this prior post that uses an alternate method of converting the PDF files to .CSV

[(1) TSA Throughput Data for US airports per hour at the checkpoint level : datasets (reddit.com)](https://www.reddit.com/r/datasets/comments/hfpyku/tsa_throughput_data_for_us_airports_per_hour_at/) 

It looks like the author ran into a problem with data extraction sometime back in July of last year. My method continues to work, and I attempt to update the data on a weekly basis (as long as TSA publishes the information). Ultimately I hope to automate the update process (source also included for that)

Please note, I started this project to learn python and machine learning concepts. I like to apply my learning to what interests me. In this case I work for an airline. My goal is to predict TSA Throughput, but boy Covid really did a number on the data. Feel free to contribute, or just use the data.

Interesting python code to look at would be

* [/src/tsa\_throughput/src/data/make\_airport\_dataset.py](https://github.com/mikelor/TsaThroughput/blob/main/src/tsa_throughput/src/data/make_airport_dataset.py) \- Creates the CSV file for specific airport
* [/src/tsa\_throughput/src/notebooks/animate.py](https://github.com/mikelor/TsaThroughput/blob/main/src/tsa_throughput/notebooks/animate.py)\- Creates an animation based on data (see attached graphic)

So I am trying to gather data from a game that me and two friends play. I need to collect the following data from each game played:

\- First, Second and Third place person for that match

\- What character each person played in that match

Which isn't all that complex... but it makes it a little too much for a basic Excel sheet style table (or at least I can't figure out how to do it).

The best I've managed is to have it like the following:

&amp;#x200B;

||Person 1|Person 2|Person 3|Placement|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Game 1|Char1|Char2|Char3|123|
|Game 2|Char1|Char4|Char4|231|
|Game 3|Char1|Char 5|Char2|321|

Which.. I mean it saves the data. But it doesn't make it very easy to actually produce something at the end of it, especially as the 123/321 format for who got first/second/third won't translate into anything particularly useful.

Help pls? I'd like to be able to pull things like ""Person 2 has a 67% winrate when playing as character X"" or things of that nature.

The Apache Lucene Project provides a powerful library for indexing and searching huge amounts of documents. Lucene is fast and allows complex queries, so you can search for comments that include some words, exclude groups of others, have been created during a specific period of time, do not occur in a list of subreddits, have a minimum of n upvotes and so on.

Size of Archive: 302 GByte, [7z format](http://www.7-zip.org/).
This index contains the whole comment dataset as payload, so if Lucene returns a hit, you can directly access the comment text.

"As per the imdb dataset documentation\[1\] the language field is only in dataset \[2\].

Now let's take an example

    $ zcat title.akas.tsv.gz | grep ^tt0014142

&amp;#x200B;

Nowhere do we see 'EN' as a language here.

And how does imdb display this title\[4\]:

    Country  United States 
    
    Language  English 

Where does this information come from? From which data set?

The data set \[2\] reflects on imdb page\[4\] as:

    Also Known As  
        Notre-Dame de Paris (France) Quasimodo (France) Le Bossu de Notre-Dame (France) Der Gl√∂ckner von Notre Dame (Germany) El jorobado de nuestra se√±ora de Par√≠s (Spain) See more ¬ª 

But where is the Country and Language coming from?

I have to create an interactive dashboard of visualisations for my final year project at University. I was wondering whether anybody knew of any sales figure data sets which I could use. If not sales figures then anything quite business related should be fine! Thanks in advance,not_spam
