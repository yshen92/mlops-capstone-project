"I’m trying to find a dataset that has race or ethnicity by address or street ?  For a cities population.

Reason is I’m trying to get an ethnicity and race breakdown from HOAs in a city compared to non HOAs. Hypothesis is that ethnicity / race is breakdown is different compared to the overall city
Population. 

There are many many HOAs in the city and willing to do it manually if I had the data by address or street. My first guess was census data but I couldn’t find an address or street breakdown on census data it just gave county or city breakdowns not as granular as I wanted. Unless I couldn’t just find it.

"I miss baseball, but luckily there are lots of full games available to watch on YouTube and other third party sites. I want to watch games not *knowing* the outcome, so when the YouTube thumbnail says “WALKOFF BLAST!” right there, that’s a spoiler I wish I could avoid. But I also want to watch exciting high-scoring, competitive games, which I quantify by the number of runs and lead changes. “Trout 5-for-5 at Yankee Stadium” or whatever does not qualify as an exciting game in my book, and neither does “Sale with 15 Ks” or something like that. Even a game where a team is down for 8 innings then has a 9th inning comeback is not what I’m looking for, I just want lots of lead changes throughout. 

I’m not sure if my idea is even possible, but basically I would like to somehow create a data set, maybe in the form of a spreadsheet. Hopefully data is available be pulled from Baseball Reference or something, let's say from years 2016-2019. **This spreadsheet would rank games by number of total runs scored and total lead changes.** Record of teams does not matter. Time in the season does not matter. Outcome of the game does not matter, and ideally the spreadsheet would *hide* that information so I don’t know who the winner is before watching. 

This spreadsheet would provide me with a list of what I would consider the most fun games to watch, so I could just dial one up online and watch it like new! How would I go about setting something like this up? Is it even possible? Is there an even fancier data visualization we could use than just a spreadsheet? 

Thanks everybody!",not_spam

"# Interested in indoor localization? 

**Dataset available containing high resolution ground truth location labels.**

**Features:** Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) (dB), accelerometer (x,y,z) (g).

**Labels:** Actual participant location (x,y,z) (m)

**Time:** UTC format.

**Subject:** Human, four total, one per home.

The data are intended to evaluate RSSI based indoor localization  methods with activity measurements provided from a user-worn wearable  device. Location labels are recorded automatically using a small camera  which registers fiducial floor tags, placed at a meter apart, as the participant carries out their  normal routines in a natural way. There are some scripted fingerprint experiments (as a standard RSSI training schemes) in each collection but the majority of the data is unscripted.

Approximately **14 hours** of annotated  wearable measurements are provided.

A user wears a wearable device on their wrist, which records  accelerometer data at 25Hz. This data is transmitted, at 5Hz, towards a  number of Bluetooth Low Energy access points (8-11) within the home.  The access points mark the packets with a Received Signal Strength  Indicator (RSSI) measurement and the accelerometer measurements are timestamped. 

&amp;#x200B;

There are some python scripts to get you started. We are working on a kaggle kernel....

"So I am currently gathering information in a spreadsheet, which has a bunch of columns of data, and I was considering making a project out of it and creating a database app that has a frontend that makes it easier and simpler (and prettier) to actually enter the data. Are there any easy (no complex coding skills required) solutions for this? 

In case it helps answer the question, the data is from a game. Smash Bros. Three players in every match (the same three players). The data gathered is (for each player)- 

 \- Character selected

 \- Rank

 \- Kills (including WHO they killed)

 \- Damage Given

 \- and then total kills and stats like deaths, averages, K/D ratio etc is calculated and displayed as running totals automatically via equations. 

&amp;#x200B;

At the moment, the kills are displayed in a slightly odd way. Basically, the players initials are N, D and J. So the 'kills' are shown as something like ""J2D1"" if the N player killed J twice and D once. In the final app I would hope for the 'enter kills' screen to automatically show two icons (J and D for N, N and J for D, etc) that can be tapped the required number of times to quickly enter the data. If this is possible. 

So yeh, this is a slightly odd one maybe. It's totally unnecessary, as I can continue to do it using the spreadsheet, but as I say I figure it'd make a cool design project for my design portfolio. My programming skills are rudimentary though, so I'd rather use something that doesn't require too much advanced programming skills...

This dataset essentially describes the rooftop solar potential for different regions, based on Google's analysis of Google Maps data to find rooftops where solar would work, and aggregate those into region-wide statistics.

It comes in a couple of aggregation flavors - by census tract ( https://gourdian.net/g/eric/sunroof_solar.solar_potential_by_censustract#summary ), where the region name is the census tract id, and by postal code ( https://gourdian.net/g/eric/sunroof_solar.solar_potential_by_postal_code#summary ), where the name is the postal code. Each also contains latitude/longitude bounding boxes and averages, so that you can download based on that, and you should be able to do custom larger aggregations using those, if you'd like.

"   Tossing this out there for anyone who might be interested in exploring cutting edge AI unsupervised machine learning tech. Having just discovered this community and being a longtime Reddit user myself I felt some urge to get an idea from professional data scientists about their thoughts with regards to your thoughts on potential application and comparison to other tools.  Currently we are a primarily eDiscovery platform that is also utilized by law enforcement and other organizations with large data sets.  We have the following data sets available to review as a demonstration:

[https://demo.agnesintel.com/](https://demo.agnesintel.com/)

* **Text Documents:** 

AGNES has provided the Enron email corpus for review in this demo. This silo provides an example of a standard email corpus. You can create research and review projects, search through the emails using pertinent names and terms, and toggle back and forth between the emails and their attachments. Watch how quickly the important documents become readily available.

* **Audio:**

AGNES shows approximately a thousand hours of the Joe Rogan podcast. AGNES platform transcribes, indexes, binds, and applies AI-powered search to audio files. Our technology shows you the entire contents of the data-set at a glance, uncovers patterns, codes and slang, and helps you find what you’re looking for faster than you thought possible.

* **Audio-Based Video:**

AGNES has provided 70 years of State of the Union Addresses to demonstrate our video capabilities. When you find a topic of interest, you will be brought right to the section of the video you’re interested in. You can explore how issues were discussed differently over time, find common threads, and use context-driven search to show you the complete picture on any issue.

We also welcome any requests with pro-bono/non-profit data sets for review, or other reasonable requests to submit your data to explore further.

Any and all feedback is appreciated and I'm sure that I, as well some other co-workers more experienced in the field, can contribute to your inquiries as well. To give a quick summary: we are an AI based platform that is an **unsupervised** technology without any need for TAR, but also has the capability to fully transcribe, index and create an organic table of contents for audio and video data, within the context of the information itself, which is what makes our tech stand out from the rest.

[https://demo.agnesintel.com/](https://demo.agnesintel.com/)

There's absolutely no commitment, hidden gimmicks, soft paywall or personal/payment info needed - but we would love to get some constructive feedback about what we want to be the most advanced AI-based data forensic tool out there.

Key attributes of our platform:

* **AI based** intuition and user input learning – more advanced and replacing TAR, training sets and “predictive coding” - Unsupervised AI machine learning
* Context based results to maximize relevancy - data is sorted into an organic table of contents, allowing user to identify issues/concepts to find that ""unknown, unknown"" information they may not even be aware of
* **Audio/Video review** – drastically reduce man-hours to review such data",not_spam

"So I am currently gathering information in a spreadsheet, which has a bunch of columns of data, and I was considering making a project out of it and creating a database app that has a frontend that makes it easier and simpler (and prettier) to actually enter the data. Are there any easy (no complex coding skills required) solutions for this? 

In case it helps answer the question, the data is from a game. Smash Bros. Three players in every match (the same three players). The data gathered is (for each player)- 

 \- Character selected

 \- Rank

 \- Kills (including WHO they killed)

 \- Damage Given

 \- and then total kills and stats like deaths, averages, K/D ratio etc is calculated and displayed as running totals automatically via equations. 

&amp;#x200B;

At the moment, the kills are displayed in a slightly odd way. Basically, the players initials are N, D and J. So the 'kills' are shown as something like ""J2D1"" if the N player killed J twice and D once. In the final app I would hope for the 'enter kills' screen to automatically show two icons (J and D for N, N and J for D, etc) that can be tapped the required number of times to quickly enter the data. If this is possible. 

So yeh, this is a slightly odd one maybe. It's totally unnecessary, as I can continue to do it using the spreadsheet, but as I say I figure it'd make a cool design project for my design portfolio. My programming skills are rudimentary though, so I'd rather use something that doesn't require too much advanced programming skills... 

Any thoughts?",not_spam

 In some papers, it referred to a dataset of Beijing. For example:

&gt;"" 2-min travel speed data collected from three remote traffic microwave sensors located on a southbound segment of a fourth ring road in Beijing City.""

&gt;"" a dataset consisting of probe vehicle data collected in the urban network of Beijing, China, during one week from June 1st (Monday) to 7th (Sunday), 2015""

"[Kaggle link](https://www.kaggle.com/colinmorris/favicons)

I made a little [notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/colinmorris/unusual-favicons-a-brief-survey) that shows some examples from the dataset, with an emphasis on exploring examples that are unusual in various ways.

Because they're naturally tiny images, (16x16 is the most common size), my hope is that they might be useful as an MNIST-like dataset that can be used to play with deep learning models without prohibitive hardware/time requirements.",not_spam

"Hi Y'all, 

I am looking for a large corpus of technical product descriptions to use in an ML project that I am working on.  An example of these kinds of data I am looking for might be like this NewEgg post for a coffee maker: https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=9SIA1JX4754385&amp;ignorebbr=1

Specifically, I am looking for textual descriptions like the kind which can be found on the ""Overview"" tab.  Going with the example above: 

""The Knox KN-TKCUP Travel Size Single Serve K-Cup Coffee Brewer is designed for people whose hectic morning routines don’t allow time to sit and enjoy a pot of coffee. The KN-TKCUP quickly brews coffee using a disposable K-Cup so you can quickly fill your travel mug and get out the door without worrying about waste or clean-up.

Quick Set-Up with Minimal Clean-up
The KN-TKCUP uses single-serving K-Cups to brew coffee so there are no coffee grounds to dispose of or coffee pots to clean. Just fill the tank with up to 12 ounces of water, place a K-Cup in the holder, and press the power button. When your coffee is done brewing, all you have to do is dispose of the K-cup and you’ll have a hot cup of coffee to enjoy on your morning commute.

Save Money on Coffee
Traditional coffee makers that use pots are great if you need to brew several cups of coffee at once, but, if you only need to make a single cup, you’re going to end up throwing out a lot of coffee. K-Cups are ideal in these circumstances because they allow you to make only the amount of coffee you need so you don’t needlessly waste water and coffee grounds.""

Anyone have an idea where I might be able to find a few million of these kinds of descriptions without scraping them?  ",not_spam

What is the data worth?

However it is not particularly rigorous (x axis is arbitrary), a bit biased towards England's imperialism and it stops at 1931. I would be interested in making a contemporary version of it, but computer-generated and using real data. Therefore I would need any of the following:

– Dataset of world population by polities

– Dataset of all country/polity surface area, or even of country borders over time, from which I can calculate the areas

– Any other idea? 

Do you know of any data source I rely on?",not_spam
I'd like to decide and show whether honey overperforms other food items or not (which food was 'the best investment' in the last 10-20 years). I couldn't find any datasets about this.

"Hi there,
I'm a hardstyle fan and recently I've started a little project that involves gathering all the hardstyle artists out there. I've found a huge list on [Partyflock.nl](https://partyflock.nl/artist/searchresult?NAME=&amp;TYPE%5B%5D=dj&amp;GENDER=&amp;COUNTRYID=&amp;GID%5B%5D=5&amp;GID%5B%5D=9&amp;GID%5B%5D=64). The list exists out of artist names which are also hyperlinks to the exclusive page of one artist in particular. Here's an example: https://imgur.com/a/jjxzM. There are famous and totally unknown artists in there. I wish to filter the famous from the unknown. I thought of a way by doing this: each artist page has a number of fans. My goal is to create an Microsoft Excel sheet with all the artists from this list, combined with their fan-count. Does anyone know a tool for me in order to do this? Any other help is welcome as well, ofcourse. Thanks in advance!

Edit: forgot to include raw hardstyle dj's in the link. This contains all the artists I want to analyze: https://partyflock.nl/artist/searchresult?NAME=&amp;GENDER=&amp;COUNTRYID=&amp;GID%5B%5D=41&amp;GID%5B%5D=48&amp;GID%5B%5D=52&amp;GID%5B%5D=55&amp;GID%5B%5D=5&amp;GID%5B%5D=9&amp;GID%5B%5D=64",not_spam

"Hey guys,

I would like to visualize the flow of nutrition in our food.

    E.g. the cow eats grass, which contains 100g of nitrogen, 50g of nitrogen gets shit out, 50 gram of nitrogen goes into milk, 10g lost during production of dairy products, 40 grams of nitrogen is found in dairy products, human etats 40 grams, shits out 30 grams  - of the 100grams which the grass contained, 10g stay in the body. 
Now imagine doing this not only for milk, but also for meat, cereals, fruit etc. 

It becomes a pretty complex diagramm pretty quick.  The program should also be able to adjust the whole sankey diagram if I change the input at the very top  (e.g. if I increase it to 110g, the 10g at the end would increase to 11g).

This is the closest example I found:

https://preview.redd.it/lekmt19tucd51.png?width=779&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c91f34b0ed8e30d0b977c9f5767875ec2993bdc5

As we use Tableau, I tried using it, however, quickly realised that Tableau ist not made for Sankeys.

I came across some freeware where you have to enter each number individually, but this is not suitable for larger projects. 

My favorite right now ist [this programm](https://www.ifu.com/e-sankey/), maybe you have other suggestions...

"Hello friends!

After a bunch of digging around I found a data set in [data.gov](https://data.gov) that would be absolutely perfect \[[Link - Nielsen: Homescan](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/nielsen-homescan)\]. How ever the problem is that the dataset is nonpublic. Is there a dataset that is similar to this one?   


Generally what I am looking for is a time series that is updated weekly or biweekly, tracks the groceries total amount of users of an area, and is around the time of a disaster (like hurricane season in Florida or shortly after a earthquake). 

(bonus points if it contains March or April of this year so it contains the impact of corona virus).

I was looking for interesting datasets and I found the dataset of [Number of International Visitors to London](http://data.london.gov.uk/dataset/number-international-visitors-london). I downloaded it and now I have a doubt, which I could share with you and try to clear as much as possible.

The xls file contains some sheets. Assume I select the 'By country' one. In the row regarding Argentina, in the first column (year 2002) I see 14,6 as value (that's rounded up).

Now, I can't understand it. The header says ""Visits (000s)"", so I think those values are thousands? I mean, that 14,6 becomes 14600? Plus, there is some ambiguity on using the comma: in the UK the . symbol is used as a decimal mark, thus I think the aforementioned value would be 14,600.00, right?

Each item has on average \~5 keywords. The total number of distinct keywords is \~1800.

I've been asked to devise a scheme of 10-15 categories based on the keywords. The main criteria is that the categories must be as mutually exclusive (and as few) as possible.

There have been a few previous attempts at categorization, but they have all been ultimately deemed unsatisfactory by the organization.

I've tried using fuzzy lookup to consolidate similar keywords, but it didn't make much of a dent in my workload. How would you approach this task?

Edit: The categories are supposed to be broad topics or ""subject areas.""

"Hi. I'm looking for a data set that could essentially be a dump from a digital answer collection (or correction) system of a school / college, for research purpose. The data set must contain some sample correct answers, against which the students / respondents have submitted their answers, followed by an evaluation ( numerical marks) for each response. I tired searching for it online, but couldn't find one. I also checked a few similarity data sets such as the quora question similarity data set from their question pairs kaggle challenge, however it doesn't suit the purpose because - 1. Marks are absent, we're just required to tell if it is similar (1) or not (0) &amp; 2. There may not be enough similar or dissimilar responses for a particular question.

"Hey all, we just released the dataset we collected at TechCrunch Disrupt to build [a computer vision powered chess board analyzer](https://devpost.com/software/chess-boss).

The dataset is available for download here: [https://public.roboflow.ai/object-detection/chess-full](https://public.roboflow.ai/object-detection/chess-full)

We also published a tutorial showing how to use it to [train a YOLO v3 object detection model](https://blog.roboflow.ai/training-a-yolov3-object-detection-model-with-a-custom-dataset/) like the one we used in our hackathon project.

PS - this is our first trial run of releasing a public dataset through [Roboflow](https://roboflow.ai), a tool we're working on to improve the computer vision workflow. We'd love to have you try it out and get your feedback.

We noticed that most of our time building computer vision powered apps was spent writing boilerplate code that wasn't specific to our project.

"I’m an undergrad that just started helping a professor with research. 

He wants me to improve his current method for getting/storing tweets. Right now, the program uses the search api and does some kind of recursive search on retweets/comments on news articles for top news outlets. The api is called with java and stored in MySQL.

Again, my goal is to improve it. My idea was to use the streaming api instead of the search api, dump everything into an amazon fire hose, store raw data in s3 and load into elastic search plus kibana as a UI. (Basically follow this tutorial https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/big-data/building-a-near-real-time-discovery-platform-with-aws/ )

The current program is logging about 35k tweets a day. Can anyone speculate if the proposed setup would be a significant improvement?

I know that speaking strictly data limits, the streaming api should have a higher capacity but I don’t how it behaves in practice. 

 I also no there are issues with time delay on the search api, and only getting a certain percentage of tweets with the streaming api.

I have updated the torrent for the Reddit comment data set.

There are two torrents:
[The first torrent](http://code.dewarim.com/reddit-2016-08.torrent) is simply a collection of all comments as collected by pushshift.io (files available individually). Format is JSON, compressed by bz2 per month. Download size: 236 GByte

[The second torrent](http://code.dewarim.com/reddit-parquet-sentiment-2016-08.torrent) contains the same data plus the sentiment score for each comment (score, max_positive, max_negative). The format is Apache Parquet, which makes this better suited for Spark/Hadoop queries. Download size: 419 GByte

With sentiment data, you can compute who is the most positive commentor of reddit (Spoiler: bots and people who compliment the ladies on /gonewild) or which [car brands](http://code.dewarim.com/index.html) are popular on reddit).

"Has everyone seen the new rule on Hospital Prospective Inpatient Pricing for medicare that came into effect Jan 1st, 2019?

&amp;#x200B;

I have been looking for this pricing for personal reasons, and found it incredibly difficult to identify where this information is located on each hospital's website. It seems like they bury it on purpose.  This kind of pricing should be easy to access and in one place for all to see.

Creating pricing transparency empowers consumers of medical services with a choice when selecting a hospital for elective or non-emergency procedures.  It's also a huge step forward in the fight to drive down medical costs in the US.

&amp;#x200B;

That's why I decided to explore creating an API and website that makes this information easy to access for consumers and engineers alike.  Is there any interest in this?  I am still working out the details, but I thought it would be good to start talking this through with my fellow geeks.  I have some pretty good engineering skills and a few friends (also engineers) who are interested in helping as well.

"Results: https://easyupload.io/e7l57l

So the Five Factor Mindfulness Scale is divided up between:

* Observe

* Describe

* Act with Awareness

* Nonjudge

* Nonreact

And I've measured the five factors combined into ""Mindfulness"" as well.

So I mostly put out this questionnaire to get an idea of internal validity. The Five Facets are fairly distinct from each other, except that it seems that Nonreactive people tend to also be Nonjudging.

A few of these questions are really weak. As an example, ""I am easily distracted"" only has four correlations greater than 30%, and only one greater than 40%: ""When I do things, my mind wanders off and I'm easily distracted.""--which is a similarly weak question. There definitely doesn't seem to be any reason to keep both questions.

It's possible that this 39 item questionnaire could be shortened significantly without any real loss. I'll be using a shortened version in the future.",not_spam

In an effort to inject more financial transparency into college sports, the Knight Commission on Intercollegiate Athletics has unveiled a revamped and innovative [College Athletics Financial Information (CAFI) Database](http://cafidatabase.knightcommission.org/). The new resource provides unprecedented access to athletics revenues, expenses, and debt as well as institution-wide academic spending for more than 220 public NCAA Division I colleges and universities dating back to 2005.

The free, open-access database provides telling documentation of major college sports finances, at a time when institutions face lawsuits to direct more financial benefits to student-athletes. For the first time, database users are able to view rich graphics that demonstrate, by institution, conference or competitive subdivision, ""Where the Money Comes From"" and ""Where the Money Goes"" in college sports.",not_spam

"Over the past two years I've built a tool for patients of chronic autoimmune and ""invisible"" illnesses to track their symptoms, treatments, and disease triggers. It recently launched to the public at www.flaredown.com after a lengthy private beta.

The goal is to use the data the Flaredown gathers to identify patterns and correlations that might help patients of these hard-to-treat illnesses. For example:

- Does X treatment affect Y symptom positively/negatively/not at all?

- Are there subsets within our current diagnoses that could more accurately represent symptoms and predict effective treatments?

- Can we reliably predict what triggers a flare for a given user or all users with a certain condition?

- Could we recommend treatments effectively, based on similarity of users rather than specific symptoms? (like Netflix recommendations for treatments) 

- Can we quantify a patients level of disease activity based on their self-reported symptoms? How different is it from our existing measures?

We're starting to accrue a real body of data by now and I want to share it with data scientists, researchers, or anyone interested in questions like the ones above. To start, I could use advice on how to format the data for this kind of use. But after that I really want to dig in and start analyzing what we've got.

"I have put together a zip file of all comments and submissions made to Reddit during the election period:

    UTC 2016-11-08 00:00:00 until UTC 2016-11-10 23:59:59 for comments
    UTC 2016-11-07 00:00:00 until UTC 2016-11-10 23:59:59 for submissions

The reason I included an extra earlier day for submissions is so that comments made at the beginning of the dataset can still (mostly) be properly linked to a submission.

All data like score information was removed because these comments and submissions were collected within a few seconds of being submitted.  This means that fields like ups, score, gilded, etc. are not included since they would be useless.  

I am making this available to academics and dataviz people who are interested in seeing how Reddit reacted during the election period.

"Following, and attempting to improve upon, [this model](https://towardsdatascience.com/automatic-speaker-recognition-using-transfer-learning-6fab63e34e74), I am creating a data set to train a convolutional neural network (CNN) to identify speakers by scraping LibriVox. In the original work, the authors used 45-minute audio clips from 57 unique speakers. These clips were trimmed into pieces with an individual duration of 5 secs, and the spectrograph for each piece was found. This served as the training set for an image-classifier CNN. The authors cited resource constraints for their choices. 

I have acquired 981 unique readers with varying runtimes (tens of minutes to hours) and have access to multiple large supercomputing clusters. I am trying to determine the optimum way to pre-process this data in terms of runtime limitations and duration of the pieces.  Are there any obvious pitfalls of using 20 ms pieces as I've seen in other models? Should I stick to a set total runtime for each reader  (e.g. 45-minute clips)?

How would you optimally prep this data?

Some things I am interested in putting into practice are A/B tests, EDA, and ML classification. Any APIs or databases are preferred to obtain unstructured data I could clean for analysis. Any help would be greatly appreciated.",not_spam
"Specially looking for a multi-class / -label (with 10+ unique labels) datasets for NLP. The features can be just a simple text field.

Context: I'm exploring transformer arquitectures and rationale extraction.

I'm organizing some code, and also because sometimes I need to ask ML related questions (models and methods), I'd like to be able to make a notebook publicly available for help, but not dependent on downloading external files.",not_spam
 Hello everyone! I have a question regarding the set up of my data-set and I just stumbled upon this subreddit and if there is any place to ask this question... it has to be here! So I have practically zero experience with Possion regression and will need to utilize it for an analysis that I was handed at my internship involving count data. I have not been fortunate enough to locate info/resources on how my actual data-set should be set up within excel before I pull it into SAS to do the analysis.... I was hoping to see if anyone had links/advice/knowledge they could bestow on me to get me going on this. Thank you all so much in advance! :),not_spam

"Hi everyone,

I'm stuck trying to figure out a way to create a dataset of car images where the images are the features and the labels are the angles at which the images were shot.

For example, if we can only see the back of the car, then the feature is the image of the back of the car and the label \`back\` (or something like that).

I have searched for something like that but the closest thing I could find is the cars-196 dataset which its labels are the make,model and year of the car.

Links to relevant dataset/papers/methodologies that will help me obtain/generate that dataset are more than welcome!

for anyone else looking for the solution to a problem like this, just use this url and pop in the longitude and latitude data (probably mixed up where lat and lon goes) and you will get a json response. The census tract is the value of the key ""BASENAME""
